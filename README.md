**MMM Engineering_QC and Testing **

**Introduction** 
Marketing Mix Modeling is used by marketers and advertisers to measure advertising effectiveness, reallocate spends across media channels and use in forecasting and optimization for ROI maximization. Taking a Bayesian approach to MMM allows advertisers to integrate prior information into modeling to account for uncertainty with model and parameters. Medis saturation, adstock and lags are built into the model.
